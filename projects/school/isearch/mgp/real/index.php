		<h2 id="article-title">About the REAL Author: David Zhan</h2>

		<p>
			I am David Zhan, a sophomore at Albany High School. When I made this in the Spring of 2018, I was an 8th grader at Albany Middle School, and this was the Multigenre Portfolio (MGP) that I made for my I-Search project. My I-Search topic was Artificial Intelligence (AI), as you can see, and I made many genres on the topic of AI. Everything that “Jack Wilson” wrote was actually written by me and is completely factual.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to do many things, such as competing in science bowl, competitively swimming, and programming. I used to play play the tenor in my school's band and jazz band, and I still quite enjoy music. I swim for the Albany Armada Aquatics and my high school swim team, and swimming is something that I really enjoy. In addition to that, I also enjoy programming. I started learning a few years ago, and now I have gotten very good at programming, and I enjoy it a lot. The website on which you are seeing this on was completely made from scratch using the languages HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really enjoyed making this website for my MGP, and I hope you enjoy it!
