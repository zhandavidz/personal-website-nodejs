			“The Age of Robots.” Current Events, Jan, 2001, pp. 2a-2d, SIRS Discoverer, http://discoverer.prod.sirs.com. This article is from a magazine Current Events reprinted on a database called SIRS Discoverer. This was written for people that want a view of the future of AI and how it works now. It is reprinted on SIRS Discoverer, a very trusted source that checks everything it has. The purpose of the source is to inform and analyze our current AI and how it might improve in the future. The kind of information this source contains is a fiction short-story, followed by an analyzation of current AI technologies and what it means. This was useful in learning about my topic because it helped give me a glimpse into what the future might be and because it gave a lot of information on current AI technologies.

			Dormehl, Luke. Thinking Machines: The Quest for Artificial Intelligence and Where It’s Taking Us Next. New York, TarcherPerigee, 2017. This source is a non-fiction book. It was written for people that want to know more about AI, from its history to its present to its future. The purpose of the source is to inform the reader on what AI is about and the history and possible future of AI is. It contains mainly facts with analyzation of all the facts. It was very useful because it was very rich and full of information that I couldn’t find anywhere else, and I learned a lot about the history of AI from it. The book starts off with the beginnings of AI, and then it moves on to how the ideas of how to make AI changed. It then talks about how AI is actually already surrounding us in ways we don’t realize. Next, it talks about what AI will do to our jobs and concludes with the risks and future of AI. The whole theme of the book is that, although we are all scared of thinking machines, history tells us we shouldn’t worry. This was a non-fiction book that was completely factual. There was a line from the book that I very enjoyed, and it was, “[Machines are] sturdy, reliable, and promise never to call in sick at the last minute.”

It is written for people that want to know more about AI. This was reprinted on SIRS Discoverer, which is a very trusted source that checks everything it has. The purpose of the source is to inform us on what AI really is, what we have now, and the possibilities of what we have in the future. It contains a lot of real-life evidence and examples combined with thoughtful analyzation and speculations.This source was useful in learning about my topic because it turned the complicated and abstract world of AI into something we could relate to and understand easily. It also taught me how some “smart” computers really weren’t smart, and what might make a computer smart.
