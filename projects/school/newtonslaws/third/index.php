					  Early on when you are learning to swim, they teach you how to float. When you are floating, there is the force of gravity pulling you down. But what makes you float? That force is from the water, and it pushes up on you. That force matches gravity, so you don&apos;t go flying up into space, but you also donâ€™t sink and drown.
