		    			<i>An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</i>
		    			</p>

		    			<p>
		    			Even though that may seem like a lot, it is actually really simple. You can compare it to diving off a swim block at a swim meet. The first part of the law: <i>An object at rest stays at rest</i>, relates to when you are on the block, ready to spring forward, but not moving yet. The second part of the law: <i>an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction</i>, relates to when you spring off the block and you are in the air.
