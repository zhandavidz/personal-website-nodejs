                            What this middle section of the law means is that the direction the object moves is the same direction as that the force causing the object to move.

                            Since the kick produces a forward force, you also go forward.

                            If your coach makes you swim with your shirt on, and your shirt soaks water and becomes heavier, you will go slower. However, if you decide to defy your coach and take it off in the pool, you will go faster because you are lighter.
