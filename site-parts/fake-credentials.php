<?php

// this is a sample template for the db-credentials.php file
// for obvious reasons, the actual file isn't included in the github, but other files may depend on this file being tehre
// if you use this in the future:
// 1) dublicate the file
// 2) rename the file to "db-credentials.php"
// 3) replace the servername, username, and password with the actual one

	$servername = "server name";
	$username = "username";
	$password = "password";
